#  Maze-Solving Robot (Simulation) 

This is a **Python-based simulation** of a robot solving a maze using **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**. It visualizes the shortest path from start to goal.



##  Features
-- Generates a random maze  
-- Implements BFS algorithm to find the shortest path  
-- Visualizes the robot's movement  
-- Easily extendable to real-world robots (Raspberry Pi, ROS)
